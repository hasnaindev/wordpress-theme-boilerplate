# WordPress Theme Boilerplate
This is a simple boilerplate with webpack configuration. It deregisters jQuery by default and removes other bloat that the WordPress theme enables and injects in the head tag. This boilerplate also use namespaces in favor of function prefixes to resolve conflicting scoping issues that may occure if any two functions have same names for some reason.
